It's been an interesting adventure working with HTML & CSS. Some knowledge stays, some is fleeting daily, some I require constant refreshers for --take this use of flexbox for example. I achieved the desired outcome after playing around for a bit, considering the instructions on FreeCodeCamp were to include our own personal flavor to the projects. Gave it a shot, and I'm not disappointed.
